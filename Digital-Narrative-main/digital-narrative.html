                    <p>Margaret and Frances Macdonald were two key pioneers of the Art Nouveau Movement who sought to transgress against the restrictions of the 18th century, emerging into a new century full of hope for liberation, both artistically and sexually.
                        In 1890, both sisters registered to enter the Glasgow School of Art, where they met Charles Rennie Mackintosh and Herbert MacNair, and would go on to create the infamous ‘Glasgow Four’ artistic collective, particularly distorting and challenging female representation. Eventually Margaret married Charles and Frances married Herbert.

                    <p>The Vienna Succession was a movement catalyzed by a break with the academic style in Vienna in 1897, where the ‘Glasgow Four’s’ work was well received. Despite Margaret’s success in Vienna, her work was greatly criticized and overshadowed by Charles’ legacy.

                    <p>On the other hand, architect and husband to Margaret Macdonald, Charles Rennie Mackintosh had a remarkable success and reaction with his work during the Vienna Succession. He created significant and celebrated architectures during 1900 to 1902, specifically the infamous Hill House, built during 1902 to 1904, deemed a ‘total work of art’ in every way; the interiors and furniture, the exterior and materials and even the textiles and fabrics used inside.  
                    </p>
                    <p>While both Margaret Macdonald and Charles Mackintosh failed to gain the attention of British critics, they gained attention elsewhere in 1902 by German critic Hermann Muthesius who thought their work was “divergent from everything that is familiar”. </p>
